# phgen

A CLI tool to generate and intercept HTTP Requests

I want a command line tool that allows me to intercept HTTP requests made from my machine and fiddle with the response. In addition I want to generate 1000s of HTTP requests to load test an app in my machine, or in another machine in the network.

Features Roadmap
-------
- Intercept HTTP requests matcing a request definition
- Act as a Proxy
- Generate HTTP Requests
- Synchronize with other phgen nodes in the network and generate in sync
